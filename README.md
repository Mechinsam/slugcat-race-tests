# About
Slugcat Race Tests (SRT) is inspired from [Horse Race Tests](https://x.com/snakesandrews/status/1915799331220684835) where Rain World slugcats race to collect food.

Built in Rust+Raylib, SRT is an open-source program that allows you to:
- Create your own maps for races
- Replace, remove, or add more racers
- Mod all external sound and image

The goal for each race is to get the food. First one to get it wins!

# Features
- Pixel-perfect collision between slugcats and walls
- Modular maps
- Fast performence (thanks to raylib and rust!)
- Multi-threaded slugcat updates
- Object-oriented (i think)
- Easy way to add more slugcat racers
- Slugcat

# Download and Usage
Windows and Linux versions avaliable on [itch.io](https://mechinsam.itch.io/slugcat-race-tests)
Both 64 bit.
Instructions are on there as well.

# Compiling
1. Download [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Clone the repo with the terminal command `git clone https://www.github.com/Mechinsam/slugcat-race-tests.git` or use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) (GUI)
3. Go into the cloned folder and open your terminal
4. Run the command `cargo run`

This will automatically build and run the program.
The program should be in the target/debug sub folder if you dont want to run that command every time (Make sure to copy the DATA folder to that directory as well)

# Modding
## Slugcats
Slugcat images are located in DATA/racers
There are two folders:
- sprites - folder for in-race sprites
- win - folder for win images

There are template files for both if you want to use those!

To add a slugcat to the game, just make a new sprite. The name of the slugcat will be pulled from the filename.
A win image is not required as a default one will be used but feel free to add one!

## Maps
Located in DATA/maps, a map folder must contain
- bg.png - background image
- col_map.png - a collision map in the form of an image. Red parts are where collisions can occur, and regions with below 25% opcaity (idealy 0%), are free zones. Borders of the image do not need their collision highlighted
- food.png - Food sprite to use for that level. Keep it roughly 200x400 to not affect scaling
- metadata.json - Contains the key 'gate_spawn_pos' (slugcat spawn position sorted in columns from their origin (top left corner)).
  Also contains the key 'food_spawn_pos'. This is where the food sprite spawns.

Use the 'd' key in the program to enable debug mode to see your fps and mouse position (useful for figuring out spawn positions).

**Your bg.png and col_map.png MUST BE 1024x768.**
If you don't like this size, you can change the SCREEN_WIDTH & SCREEN_HEIGHT variables in main.rs and recompile but this will make pre-packaged maps incompatiable

# Additional stuff
There are a few special slugcats in the program. Namely:
- Kor (me)
- Vulkan ([VulkƒÅns](https://x.com/Wheedless))
- Swordmaster ([Ikepike](https://x.com/ikepik3))
