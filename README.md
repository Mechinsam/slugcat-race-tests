Like [Horse Race Tests](https://x.com/snakesandrews/status/1915799331220684835) but for slugcats.

You can easily change out the racers, add new ones, remove them, and make your own custom maps!

# Features
- Pixel-perfect collision between slugcats and walls
- Modular maps
- Fast performence (thanks to raylib and rust!)
- Multi-threaded slugcat updates
- Object-oriented (i think)
- Easy way to add more slugcat racers
- Slugcat
